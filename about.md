The [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/) (CEDA) runs the UK's national data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research, hosting Petabytes of data.

The CEDA Archive is principally funded by the UK [Natural Environment Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/) (NERC). We are part of [NERC's Environmental Data Service (EDS)](https://eds.ukri.org/) - a network of data centres covering all aspects of environmental science. The EDS provides a focal point for NERC's scientific data and information. We work with the other data centres to ensure that environmental data is deposited in the most appropriate archive.

CEDA is embedded in of the [National Centre for Atmospheric Science](https://ncas.ac.uk/) (NCAS) and the [National Centre for Earth Observation](https://www.nceo.ac.uk/) (NCEO). This keeps us in close contact with our main user comminuties. 

The aim of the CEDA Archive is to provide a long-term home for data produced by environmental research and to facilitate use of data that research needs.
