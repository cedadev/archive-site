Help on MIDAS stations search
=============================

Using the stations map
----------------------

The MIDAS stations map page allows selected MIDAS stations to be displayed on a map.

To display stations first select the type of stations to be displayed from the drop-down list. You can select stations according to the specific [message type](/midas_stations/met_domains) they produce, or you can select the composite type _Upper air stations_, or you can select all stations (the default). For more help on the difference message types see the [Met Office Surface Stations Users Guide](https://artefacts.ceda.ac.uk/badc_datadocs/ukmo-midas/ukmo_guide.html)

Next, select an area, using one of the area selection methods provided and press the appropriate _Display_ button. There are several methods of selecting an area. For example you can select all the stations in a given UK county, or all the stations in a given country.

In the case of the postcode search you can specify up to 5 characters from the start of a postcode. It is usually advisable to use only the first half of the postcode, for example 'OX12'. This will display all stations whose postcode starts with 'OX12'. Specifying more characters will not find any more stations. You can also specify fewer characters. For example, 'OX' will display all stations in the Oxfordshire postal area. Note that usually only 5 significant characters of the stations postcode are recorded. See [Postcode area map](http://www.evoxfacilities.co.uk/areamaps.php) or [List of postal areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom) for more information on postcodes.

Note that in the county search the county names may not correspond to the current county divisions. Most of the county names used are 'traditional' names (See [map of traditional counties](/midas_stations/traditional_counties_map)).

As searching and displaying stations can be quite slow you are advised to select the minimum area required for your search.
