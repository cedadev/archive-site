<h1>UK COLONIAL REGISTERS AND ROYAL NAVY LOGBOOKS:
  making the past available for the future</h1>

<hr align="LEFT">


<a href="http://www.corral.org.uk/">CORRAL (UK Colonial Registers and Royal Navy Logbooks)
(project home page)</a> uses late 18th to early 20th century archive material to enhance the global
coverage of daily to sub-daily weather observations. These are essential for current research that
requires an enhancement in the quality and quantity of past data in order to assess better the full
nature of medium- to long-term climate variability and change. Three distinct but complimentary
and hitherto untapped sources will be used, two are based on Royal Navy ship’s logbooks (from
ships of voyages of scientific discovery and those in the service of the Hydrographic Survey), the
third being the coastal and island records contained in UK Colonial documents. The former of the
three categories constitute documents of national and historical importance, with a corresponding
need to make them freely available through managed websites. In all three instances, the
instrumental data (mostly of air pressure and temperature) are of singular importance in
representing marine conditions; this being an area that is traditionally under-represented in the
climate record despite it occupying over two-thirds of the planet’s surface. All these data will be
abstracted, verified and made available to the scientific community through the British Atmospheric
Data Centre (BADC) website. 
Most documents are to be found in The National Archives (Kew).


<h2>Records of the Admiralty, Naval Forces, Royal Marines, Coastguard, and related bodies [ADM]</h2>

These records are held at The National Archive, Kew. The
ADM section includes records of the Admiralty, Naval Forces, Royal Marines, Coastguard, and
related bodies, concerning all aspects of the organisation and operation of the Royal Navy and associated naval forces,
over the period 1205-1998 (more details are available in the National Archives
<a target="_other" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=4&amp;CATLN=1">catalogue entry</a>).

The CORRAL project deals with the following series:
<ul>
<li><a href="adm51/adm51_index.html">ADM51: Admiralty: Captains' Logs, 1669-1853</a></li>
<li><a href="adm53/adm53_index.html">ADM53: Admiralty: and Ministry of Defence, Navy Department: Ships' Logs 1799-1985</a></li>
<li><a href="adm55/adm55_index.html">ADM55: Admiralty: Supplementary Logs and Journals of Ships on Exploration, 1757-1861; 1904</a>, including logs from the voyages of James Cook.</li>
</ul>
