<p>JASMIN is a globally-unique data analysis facility. It provides storage and compute facilities to enable data-intensive environmental science.</p>

<p>Over <a href="/users/community/">1500 users</a> are currently supported <a href="/insights">exploring topics</a>  ranging from climate change and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation and analysis of wildlife populations.</p>

<p>Centred more around storage and data analysis than a “traditional” supercomputer, JASMIN provides flexibility for a wide range of data-intensive analysis workflows.</p>

<p>Tens of petabytes of storage are combined with <a href="/about/services/">several types of compute resource</a>: managed interactive and batch compute for building and executing large workflows, and a “community cloud” offering projects and communities a set of service components with which to build and manage their own computing needs. All with high-performance access to massive data resources, including the curated archives of the <a href="https://www.ceda.ac.uk">Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)</a>.</p>

<p>JASMIN is designed, integrated and operated by the <a href="https://stfc.ukri.org/">Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council (STFC)</a> on behalf of the <a href="https://nerc.ukri.org/">Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</a>.</p>

<p>Architected jointly between STFC’s <a href="https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/">Scientific Computing Department</a> and <a href="https://www.ceda.ac.uk/">CEDA</a> within <a href="https://www.ralspace.stfc.ac.uk/">RAL Space</a>, it is operated and supported by a <a href="/about/team/">small but innovative team</a> with expertise in systems administration, computer science, research software engineering and environmental informatics.</p>

                        <!-- <p><p>JASMIN’s main purpose is to provide large-scale data analysis facilities to support data-intensive environmental science. To enable this, it provides a number of services in a unique purpose-built architecture to enable groups of scientists to work together collaboratively with large datasets. We can group (and colour-code!) these service groups as follows:</p>

                        <!-- <p><p>Since JASMIN came into being in early 2012, it has grown significantly in scale and complexity but also in the number and variety of users it serves, and the types of scientific workflow it supports. As the requirements of its user community evolve, so does JASMIN. The Phases below describe the major procurement and upgrade projects which have taken place. These have been complemented by the work of teams within CEDA and STFC’s scientific computing department in developing and maintaining the infrastructure and its component services and software to create the major e-infrastructure facility now familiar to over 1,500 users and 200 science projects.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1-20112012">Phase 1 (2011/2012)</h3>

<h4 id="a-super-data-cluster-is-born">A “super-data-cluster” is born</h4>

<p>he initial technical architecture was selected to provide a flexible, high-performance storage and data analysis environment, supporting batch computing, hosted processing and a cloud environment. The CEDA Archive had outgrown its previous hosting environment and the increasing need for scientific workdlows to “bring the compute to the data” drove the development of an infrastructure to support analysis of archive data alongside datasets brought into or generated by projects in their own collaborative workspaces.</p>

<p>The first components deployed in this phase were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low latency core network</li>
  <li>High-performance disk storage system supporting parallel write</li>
  <li>Access to expandable tape storage for near-line storage</li>
  <li>Resources to support bare-metal and virtualised compute</li>
  <li>A batch scheduler</li>
  <li>Block storage for storing virtual machine images</li>
  <li>A paper describing the initial architecture is available (doi:10.1109/BigData.2013.6691556).</li>

<h4 id="interim-upgrades-and-strategic-proof-of-concept-projects">Interim upgrades and strategic proof-of-concept projects</h4>
<p>Ahead of larger investments in years to come, limited but carefully-targetted upgrades ensured that key systems continued to operate at the scales needed. A proof-of-concept project tested the feasibility of using OpenStack instead of a proprietary solution for JASMIN’s growing Community Cloud infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="phase-4-201718">Phase 4 (2017/18)</h3>

<h4 id="major-expansion-with-new-technologies">Major expansion with new technologies</h4>

<p>Phase 4 introduced new types of storage at the scales needed to support scientific workflows into the future. Successful proofs-of-concept with Scale Out Filesystem (SOF) and high-performance object storage (HPOS) enabled large deployments of these, with SOF adopted as the primary storage medium for Group Workspace storage, and tooling and services under development to enable use of object storage within cloud-based workflows. LOTUS gained a major upgrade of &gt;5000 cores, in a network enhanced for future expansion. Cloud tenancies were migrated to an OpenStack platform and management interfaces adapted to match. Meanwhile testbeds for Cluster-as-a-Service and JuPyter Notebooks provided previews of exciting capabilities to come.</p>

<h4 id="tape-storage--other-strategic-upgrades">Tape storage &amp; other strategic upgrades</h4>

<p>Together with STFC’s IRIS consortium, a major upgrade to a shared tape storage facility was procured with capacity for 65 PB of near-line storage. JASMIN also acquired its first GPU servers: a small prrof-of-concept cluster of 5 systems.</p>

<p>It was time to say goodbye to several tonnes of storage and compute hardware from previous phases which were now retired, and needed to be removed to make room for new equipment.</p>

<h4 id="batch-compute-upgrade-and-network-improvements">Batch compute upgrade and network improvements</h4>

<p>LOTUS was the main focus of this phase with the replacement of old compute nodes with new higher-memory servers and work to migrate from Platform LSF to SLURM as the scheduler. A change of operating system also meant redeployment of CEDA and JASMIN service hosts throughout the system.</p>

<p>JASMIN’s operating costs include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Staffing</li>
  <li>Hardware and software maintenance and smaller purchases</li>
  <li>Licence costs for hardware and software</li>
  <li>User engagement activities</li>
  <li>Travel and subsistence for JASMIN staff</li>
</ul>

<p>and are provided by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a service-level agreement between NERC and JASMIN’s host institution, STFC (~65%)</li>
  <li>“cost-recovery” charged to tenant projects where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="capital">Capital</h3>

<p>Capital funding is required to procure and integrate the major hardware, software and other assets which form the JASMIN infrastructure, from which the required service can be delivered.</p>

<p>Procurement phases are aligned with financial years and are principally provided from BEIS on behalf of NERC to STFC. The level of investment over the JASMIN phases to date, is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Governance for JASMIN is provided by two bodies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The CEDA/JASMIN Board is composed of representatives from JASMIN’s stakeholder community including funding bodies, host organisations and others. It defines the service which CEDA and JASMIN provide to their respective communities.</li>
  <li>The JASMIN Programme Board oversees delivery of JASMIN as an operational service and manages the major procurement and integration projects which are undertaken to maintain, refresh and expand JASMIN’s infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information about governance and stakeholder community information is available in CEDA’s Annual Reports.</p>
