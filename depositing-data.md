Our main goal is to ensure that atmospheric and earth observation data are made available and accessible to all in order to fully realise their reuse potential.

[Our team](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/about/team/) provides advice and guidance to researchers on best practice for data management. We ensure that the data researchers produce are curated appropriately for the long-term, guaranteeing their security, accessibility and re-usability for the wider community.

We accept environmental data in suitable [standard data formats](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/category/4423-formats). Priority is given to data generated as a result of funding by the [Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)](https://nerc.ukri.org/), however, data generated through other funding sources will also be considered for deposit at the discretion of the CEDA Archive.

If you wish to deposit data with us, please see the [documentation here](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/category/13-archiving-data-with-ceda). If you have any questions about depositing data, please contact our [Data Management helpdesk](mailto:data.management@ceda.ac.uk).
