### Resource

JASMIN's operating costs include:

* Staffing
* Hardware and software maintenance and smaller purchases
* Licence costs for hardware and software
* User engagement activities
* Travel and subsistence for JASMIN staff

and are provided by:

* a service-level agreement between NERC and JASMIN's host institution, STFC (~65%)
* "cost-recovery" charged to tenant projects where appropriate

### Capital

Capital funding is required to procure and integrate the major hardware, software and other assets which form the JASMIN infrastructure, from which the required service can be delivered.

Procurement phases are aligned with financial years and are principally provided from BEIS on behalf of NERC to STFC. The level of investment over the JASMIN phases to date, is shown in the table below.
